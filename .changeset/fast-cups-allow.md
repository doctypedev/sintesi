🧠 Smarter Context & RAG
We've upgraded our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. The system now utilizes query caching and reranking timeouts to ensure that the most relevant context is retrieved without bottlenecking the process. Furthermore, code skeletonization now allows the LLM to focus on logic rather than boilerplate.

💎 Polished Output & Formatting

- Prettier Integration: All generated code blocks and documentation are now automatically formatted via Prettier.

- Mermaid Diagrams: Refined prompt engineering significantly reduces syntax errors in generated diagrams.

- YAML & Metadata: Enhanced quoting and formatting rules ensure that all documentation headers are valid and parsable.

- Strict Styling: Introduced new styling rules to maintain a consistent tone and voice across all generated pages.

- ⚡ Performance & Scalability
  High Concurrency: Documentation generation is now significantly faster thanks to increased task concurrency.

- Site Restructure: Optimized the underlying folder structure and navigation for a more intuitive user experience.
