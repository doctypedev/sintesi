# Doctype

Doctype is the ultimate guardrail for conceptual documentation. By leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis and Generative AI (GenAI), it guarantees the veracity of your Markdown guides in real-time. If the code changes, the documentation updates automatically.

## Features

- **Real-Time Documentation Updates**: Automatically updates documentation when code changes, ensuring that your guides are always up-to-date.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Utilizes AI models to provide insights and suggestions for documentation improvements.
