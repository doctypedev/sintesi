> **The intelligent documentation engine.**

Sintesi guarantees your documentation never drifts from your codebase. It uses **multi-agent AI** to analyze your source code, plan a documentation structure, and write comprehensive, up-to-date docs. No outdated wikis, no "docs rot".

---

## ⚡️ Why Sintesi?

Traditional docs rot. Sintesi keeps them fresh.

-   **🛡️ Drift Protection:** Detects inconsistencies between code and docs before you merge.
-   **🕵️ Context-Aware:** Reads your actual source code to write specific, accurate documentation.
-   **🤖 Multi-Agent:** Uses specialized agents (Planner, Writer, Reviewer) to produce high-quality content.
-   **📦 Monorepo Native:** Designed for complex workspaces from day one.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1.  **Install**
    ```bash
    npm install -g @sintesi/sintesi
    ```

2.  **Generate Documentation**
    Don't have docs? Let Sintesi inspect your code and create a living documentation site.
    ```bash
    sintesi documentation
    ```
    Or just a README:
    ```bash
    sintesi readme
    ```

3.  **Verify Integrity**
    Run this in your CI/CD. If the code changed but docs didn't, this returns exit code 1.
    ```bash
    sintesi check
    ```
    The `check` command now performs dual drift detection for both the README and the documentation site. You can use the `--no-strict` flag to allow non-blocking CI usage.

## 🧠 How it works

Sintesi is not just a generator; it is a full **documentation lifecycle manager**.

1.  **Analyze:** It scans your project structure and reads key files to understand the "DNA" of your codebase.
2.  **Plan:** An AI Architect designs a documentation structure tailored to your project type.
3.  **Generate:** Specialized agents write comprehensive documentation, ensuring accuracy by reading actual source code.
4.  **Verify:** The `check` command ensures your documentation stays in sync with your latest code changes.
