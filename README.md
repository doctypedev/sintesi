## ✨ Key Features

### 📄 Instant README
Starting a new project? `sintesi readme` scans your file structure, `package.json`, and source code to generate a comprehensive, professional `README.md` in seconds. It even detects recent git changes to keep it updated.

### 🧠 Smart Context
Sintesi doesn't just read files; it understands your project architecture. It analyzes imports, exports, and dependencies to write documentation that explains *why*, not just *what*.

### 🎨 Site Mode
Turn your repository into a full-fledged documentation website.
`sintesi documentation --site` organizes your content into guides, references, and API docs, complete with:
- **Automatic Sidebar** navigation
- **Mermaid Diagrams** for flows
- **Rich Frontmatter** for SEO and metadata

### 🛡️ Drift Protection
Never merge undocumented code again.
`sintesi check` verifies that every exported function, class, and component has up-to-date documentation matching its current signature.
