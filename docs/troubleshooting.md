# Troubleshooting Guide for sintesi-monorepo-root CLI Tool

This document provides guidance on resolving common issues and errors encountered while using the Sintesi CLI tool. If you encounter problems, refer to the sections below to troubleshoot effectively.

## Common Issues

### 1. CLI Command Fails to Execute

**Symptoms:**
- The command does not run or returns an error message.

**Possible Solutions:**
- Ensure you are in the correct directory where the Sintesi CLI is installed.
- Check if you have the necessary permissions to execute the command.
- Verify that you have the required environment variables set, especially if your command interacts with external services (e.g., AI models).

### 2. Drift Detection Fails

**Symptoms:**
- The command does not detect changes in the code or documentation.

**Possible Solutions:**
- Ensure that your code changes are correctly reflected in the version control system (e.g., Git).
- Run the command with verbose logging to get more insights: 
  ```bash
  sintesi-cli check --smart --verbose
  ```
- Check if the `sintesi-map.json` file is correctly configured and up-to-date.

### 3. Documentation Generation Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Generated documentation does not reflect the latest code changes.

**Possible Solutions:**
- Ensure that the `sintesi.config.json` file is correctly set up with valid paths.
- Run the documentation command with the `--output-dir` flag to specify the output location:
  ```bash
  sintesi-cli documentation --output-dir docs --verbose
  ```
- If using AI for documentation generation, ensure your API keys are correctly set in the environment variables.

### 4. Dry Run Mode Not Working as Expected

**Symptoms:**
- Changes are made even when the dry run option is enabled.

**Possible Solutions:**
- Ensure you are using the `--dry-run` flag correctly:
  ```bash
  sintesi-cli fix --map sintesi-map.json --dry-run
  ```
- Check the implementation of the command to ensure it respects the dry run option.

## Usage Examples

### Fix Command

To fix drift by updating documentation, use the following command:

```bash
sintesi-cli fix --map sintesi-map.json --verbose
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- The command should return a success message indicating the number of fixes made. If you want to perform a dry run, add the `--dry-run` flag:

```bash
sintesi-cli fix --map sintesi-map.json --dry-run
```

### Init Command

To create a new configuration file with default values, run:

```bash
sintesi-cli init --verbose
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- A new `sintesi.config.json` file should be created in the current directory.
